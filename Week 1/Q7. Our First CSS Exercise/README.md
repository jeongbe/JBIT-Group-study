# Our First CSS Exercise
Time for some basic CSS practice! I've provided you with some basic HTML markup in `index.html`, please don't touch it!  I've also made a `styles.css` file for you to work in.  Please style the elements according to these rules:

h1s

     - green text
     
h2s

     - magenta text
     
paragraphs

    - white text
    
    - black background color
    
buttons

    - red text
    
    - pink background color
    
    
If done correctly, you'll see this stunningly beautiful result:
